Create a Personal Assistant with OpenAI's ChatGPT

Introduction
Welcome to this guided project about creating a personal assistant using OpenAI. The guided project takes you through building a chatbot that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The personal assistant chatbot will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.
