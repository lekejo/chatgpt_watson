**Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson**

Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson

Estimated time needed: 1 hour

**Introduction**
Welcome to this guided project on creating a voice assistant using OpenAI and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed. The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user. The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.


By the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of voice assistants and the skills to create your own AI-powered assistant that can communicate through voice input and output. You will also have a strong foundation in web development using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a finished full stack impressive application!

Before you begin, let's give some context of each topic.

**OpenAI**
OpenAI is a research organization that aims to promote and develop friendly artificial intelligence in a way that benefits humanity as a whole. One of their key projects is GPT-3, which is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. You will be using GPT-3 in your assistant to allow it to understand and respond to a wide range of user inputs.

**IBM Watson speech libraries for embed**
IBM Watson® Speech Libraries for Embed are a set of containerized text-to-speech and speech-to-text libraries designed to offer our IBM partners greater flexibility to infuse the best of IBM Research® technology into their solutions. Now available as embeddable AI, partners gain greater capabilities to build voice transcription and voice synthesis applications more quickly and deploy them in any hybrid multi-cloud environment. These technologies allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice input and output.

**Voice assistants**
A virtual assistant is a program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet using natural human voice. Assistants can be used in a variety of industries, including customer service, e-commerce, and education.

**Python (Flask)**
Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in web development and data science. Flask is a web framework for Python that makes it easy to build web applications. You will be using Python and Flask to build the backend of your voice assistant. Python is a powerful language that is easy to learn and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be leveraged in projects like yours.

**HTML - CSS - Javascript**
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure content on the web. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Javascript is a programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity to web pages. Together, these technologies allow us to build a visually appealing and interactive frontend for your assistant. Users will be able to interact with the voice assistant through a web interface that's built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

**Learning objectives**
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

Explain the basics of voice assistants and their various applications
Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users
Integrate the assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests
Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output
Combine all the above components to create a functional assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response
(Optional) Deploy the assistant to a web server for use by a wider audience
Prerequisites
Having knowledge of the basics of HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Python are nice to have but not essential. We will do our best in explaining each step of the process as well as any code shown along the way.
